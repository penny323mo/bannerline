# Changelog

## M1 — playable vertical slice

- Soft low-poly island, mint against coral, glowing ownership line.
- Headquarters and barracks. Barracks refill over time; count badges follow the crowds.
- Tap-tap or drag to send a whole stack. Instanced soldiers march, clash by subtraction, and capture buildings.
- Win sheet when the enemy headquarters falls. Lose sheet when yours does.
- Mute toggle persisted in `localStorage`.
- Node tests for combat math, capture, march, and match outcomes.

## Round 0 — scaffold

- PLAN.md, orch.json, build prompt, GitHub Pages target.

## Round 1 fixes

- Count pills, roofs, and flags take a tap or a drag-release within 44 CSS pixels. The ground disc still selects the building foot.
- A drag that does not send puts the hint back on the real selection.
- A friendly arrival fills a building only up to its cap. Extra soldiers stay with the squad.
- A player order leaves a small garrison. The enemy barracks waits until after the player barracks first reads 滿, and a 14-troop enemy headquarters can still probe.
- The ownership glow reuses one zone list and one segment buffer.
